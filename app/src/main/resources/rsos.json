Also, we strive to create and maintain a physical setting which is conducive to study and intellectual growth. In addition, we strive to attain and uphold within our Chapter an environment of honour, respectability, and temperance. Section 3. One of the foundational purposes of Illinois Eta is to offer beneficial guidance to its members in the latter stages of their growth towards mature adulthood. It is hoped that all of the members of this Chapter will walk away with a well developed sense of honour and personal responsibility consistent with Robert Morrison's guiding principle, \"To do what ought to be done but what would not have been done unless I did it, I thought to be my duty.\" Section 4. Illinois Eta seeks to promote within its members a sense of community interest and activism. Through participation in service projects and other interactions with the local community and its representatives, it is believed that the members of the Chapter will come to recognize the non-material rewards such service brings as well as the enjoyment of work done not for personal gain. Section 5. As it is recognized that the health of the Greek system nationally and on campus has a significant effect on our Fraternity and our Chapter, Illinois Eta encourages its members to make positive contributions to inter-Greek relations and to work together with other fraternities and sororities in unity to present the community (locally and nationally) with a benevolent public image that the Greek system may be seen as an asset to the community."

The fundamental purpose of the SGI-BWP is to help students unlock their hidden potential and achieve creative harmony with their environment through the philosophy and practice of Nichiren Buddhism in the SGI-USA. This is the ultimate expression of individual empowerment – that each student can transform the inevitable challenges of daily life into sources of growth and fulfillment and become a positive influence in his or her school, workplace, family and community. By promoting and understanding of how Nichiren Buddhism can be applied to the challenges of modern living, our activities contribute to the development of peace, culture, and education within society, inspire respect for cultural diversity and human rights, and encourage the protection of nature and the environment."

Children are matched with musical instructors who serve as positive role models. How Does it Work? Arpeggia is designed to develop and enhance musicianship in individuals who want to learn about the language of music. Students, with the help of their mentors, explore the basics of music literacy and instrumental techniques through hands-on learning with the instrument of their choosing. What Do We Offer? Children gain the opportunity to develop their musical abilities and facilitate meaningful connections with instructors. College musicians gain real-life experience in music education. Parents see their children learn new skills. Schools supplement their music education program. How Do We Compare To The Competition? Music apps are fun and inexpensive but provide minimal education. Arpeggia’s curriculum is specifically tailored to ensure students have fun while developing real musical skills. The average private lesson costs $60/hour, making lessons inaccessible to many. In comparison, Arpeggia lessons are completely free. Private one-on-one instruction with out-of-touch professionals is endurable for some children, but our group classes and workshops not only teach music in a fun manner, it allows students to build their musicianship with a community. Who Are We? Arpeggia is a group of multitalented students from the University of Illinois dedicated to making music accessible to all communities. The founders consist of 4 musicians with 30+ years of music and education experience between them. Arpeggia was born after winning Startup 54, a start-up competition at the U of I."

We are looking to create more opportunities for open conversation, develop new resources, and advocate for policy changes in the Computer Science department and Engineering-wide. Additionally, we raise awareness in the student community through events throughout the semester. We hope to increase dialogue around mental health, especially in the tech ecosystem. We also already have rapport and open channels of communication with the CS department and are actively looking to make Computer Science a more welcoming and accessible discipline to anyone that wants to join our community.

Over time, this creates a network of teams stratified by years of experience on Hive. As a feature of this form of stratification, Hive has its more experienced members educate and coach the newer teams through traditions passed down by word of mouth, written word, historical/archival video content, etc. In addition to the years-of-experience-based teams, Hive Society seeks to create and maintain the infrastructure to support “elective” teams within its network. These elective teams offer Hive Society members more creative outlets with which to strengthen their improvisational and comedic skills. This is made possible through more diverse offerings of improv opportunities like music, stand-up, and more. All of the teams in the network seek to contribute to the overall strength of the greater Hive Society network as well as the betterment of Illinois Improv Comedy as a whole"

The club aims to provide a creative space for artists to dedicate time in their schedule to improve their skills, learn new techniques/mediums, and gain inspiration from fellow members. We also strive to be a place for people with no experience to begin their painting journey with access to resources and support. Painting is a hobby that is often time consuming, messy, and hard to justify fitting into a busy student’s schedule, but we believe that with a dedicated time and space to work along in a creative environment, students’ skills will flourish, and they will be proud of the pieces they create."

Analysts are formally trained in their first-semester through a bootcamp phase by the Membership Director on a curriculum specifically designed for VCA which includes weekly meetings, events with other organizations in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, guest speakers, and more. Analysts that are interested in moving to the “Associate Program” are staffed on projects in which they gain real-world experience working for a VC to either perform industry research, source investment opportunities, conduct due diligence, or consult on a portfolio company. These types of projects are outlined in the “Project Management Outline” section. Associates work hand-in-hand under a project manager. Every partner is assigned at least one project manager to serve as the point-of-contact and to oversee project completion. Through the efforts outlined above, VCA strives to create a unique pipeline into the venture capital industry for the brightest students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
